# Gaardlauget Christianshavn
This is a website made for an owners association in Christianshavn, Denmark. It's my first project written in Django, but revisited to fix some things that were broken in the old version

# What's new
The fix consists mainly of structural changes in apps, templates and urls, but some contents in some views and templates have also been altered.

# TODO:

- redo docs menu
- rework news views to minimize
